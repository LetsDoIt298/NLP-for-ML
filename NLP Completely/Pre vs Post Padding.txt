Pre-padding is generally considered better than post-padding for most applications, particularly in machine learning and deep learning, for these reasons:-
1. Temporal Alignment: Pre-padding preserves the alignment of the original sequence by placing padding at the start. This ensures that the sequence's meaningful elements align consistently when processing sequences of different lengths.

2. Compatibility with Models: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs or GRUs, process sequences from the start to the end. Pre-padding keeps the later parts of the sequence (which may contain more recent or relevant information) accessible to the model without interference.

3. Ease of Truncation: When using fixed-length inputs, pre-padding allows truncation(process of shortening a sequence) from the end of the sequence, reducing the risk of discarding meaningful data at the beginning.
